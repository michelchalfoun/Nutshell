# Nutshell Project - OS
#### _Michel El Chalfoun_ and _Masen Beliveau_
This assignment takes in a csv file of cancer data and is analyzed by four clustering methods. The program's output will be each algorithm's runtime, the score, and 3 outliers.
***
## Running the Nutshell
Run `make` in the terminal, making sure you're inside the directory with the source files and Makefile. Then run `./nutshell` to start up the Nutshell. If you would like to exit out of the Nutshell simply run the `bye` command.
