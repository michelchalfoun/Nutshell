## Contributions
##### Michel El Chalfoun
Worked on coding the inputs in the **word section**, **other commands including** I/O redirection, piping, wildcard matching, and the **extra credit**. 

##### Masen Beliveau
Worked on coding **built-in commands section**, mainly implementing env (set, get, print), HOME and PATH variables, cd word, and alias.

Both Michel and Masen worked on error handling, where Michel focused on handling errors before they happened, and Masen focusing on running through the sample test commands and debugging any errors that arised, while both still overlapped across the two.
